<h6> A. Visuomotor Paradigm</h6>

<p> The GIFT contains an example data-set which employs visuomotor paradigm 
(Figure 1). The paradigm contains two identical but spatially offset, periodic, 
visual stimuli, shifted by 20 seconds from one another. The visual stimuli were 
projected via an LCD projector onto a rear-projection screen subtending 
approximately 25 degrees of visual field, visible via a mirror attached to the 
MRI head coil. The stimuli consisted of an 8 Hz reversing checkerboard pattern 
presented for 15 seconds in the right visual hemifield, followed by 5 seconds of 
an asterisk fixation, followed by 15 seconds of checkerboard presented to the 
left visual hemifield, followed by 20 seconds of an asterisk fixation. The 55 
second set of events was repeated four times for a total of 220 seconds. The 
motor stimuli consisted of participants touching their right thumb to each of 
their four fingers sequentially, back and forth, at a self-paced rate using the 
hand on the same side on which the visual stimulus is presented. fMRI data from 
this paradigm, when analyzed with standard ICA, separates into two different 
task-related components (one in left visual and motor cortex, one in right 
visual and motor cortex).</p>
