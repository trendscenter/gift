<h4> SPM Stats </h4>
<hr> 

You can test the significance of components by doing a one sample t-test or two 
sample t-test on individual subject component images. We now provide an option in GIFT to do one sample 
t-test or two sample t-test on images using SPM5. 

<ul> 

<li> One sample t-test - One sample t-test for each component will be automatically 
calculated if you set variable SPM_STATS_WRITE_TAL in 
'icatb_defaults.m' to 1 or 2. If you set variable 
"SPM_STATS_WRITE_TAL" value to 1 only one sample t-test will be 
calculated whereas a value of 2 will also write talairach tables for the 
t-map. </li>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Note:</strong> An option is also provided in 
	<a target="_self" href="icatb_getting_started.htm">Utilities</a> drop down box to calculate t-maps for the selected 
data-sets.
</ul>

<li> Two sample t-test - When you click
<a target="_self" href="icatb_getting_started.htm">Utilities</a> drop down box and have selected SPM Stats as the option, a 
figure window will open to select the design criteria. When you select design as 
"Two sample t-test", two sample t-test for a component will be calculated 
between the selected groups by using a explicit mask. The explicit mask is 
calculated by applying a threshold (SPM_STATS_TTEST_THRESHOLD) on t-map 
obtained by doing a one sample t-test on data-sets. 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Note:</strong>
When you set SPM_STATS_TTEST2_EXPLICIT_MASK variable in 
'icatb_defaults.m' file to 0, explicit mask is not used. </li>
</ul>
