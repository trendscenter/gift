<h4> Data selection </h4>

<hr>

<p> There are two ways to select the data (Figure 1). After you have selected 
'Yes' for the question 'Is your data stored in one folder?', figure window 
(Figure 2) to select the root folder for subjects and sessions will be opened. 
Figure 3 is used to get the common file pattern of the images (like Oddball.mat) and 
answer for question 'Are the session folders inside subject folders?'. If 'Yes' 
is selected for the previous question, data with the matching file pattern from 
each subject sub-folder will be used.</p>
		<b>Note:</b> 
		
		<ul>
		<li> The number of sessions with the matching file pattern must 
be the same over subjects.</li>
<li> Each subject's session must contain only one MAT file with the matching 
file pattern. The dimensions of the data are time by trials by electrodes.</li>
		</ul>
