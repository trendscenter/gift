<h4> Sorting Components </h4>

<hr>

<p>Sorting is a way to classify the components. For every independent 
component spatial maps and time courses are generated. Components can be sorted 
in two ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Temporal Sorting </li>
  <li> Spatial Sorting </li>
</ul>

<p> Select  'Yes' for sort components in the Component Explorer and click <em>Display</em> button then a dialog box 
will pop up that shows the information about the sorting. Click <em>Ok</em> for the 
dialog button and then a figure will open in a new window. Figure below shows 
the completed parameters.</p>

<p>The following are the definitions of the parameters:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Sorting Criteria </dt>
  <dd>There are three different types of sorting criteria like Multiple 
  Regression, Correlation, Kurtosis and Maximum Voxel. </dd>
  <dt>What do you want to sort? </dt>
  <dd>There are four options for temporal sorting depending upon the number of 
  subjects and sessions you select. </dd>
  <ul>
    <li>Select any Subject any session - A particular subject's session is 
    selected and correlated with the model time course. </li>
    <li>Select a particular session of all subjects - A particular session for 
    all subjects is selected, time courses are concatenated and correlated with 
    the concatenated model time course. </li>
    <li>Select a particular Subject - A particular subject's sessions are 
    selected, time courses are concatenated and correlated with the model time 
    course. </li>
    <li>Select all Subjects and Sessions - All data sets are concatenated and 
    correlated with the model time course. 
    </li></ul>
  <dt>Sorting Type  </dt>
  <dd>Temporal or Spatial. 
  </dd>
  <dt>Reference Function </dt>
  <dd>You have a good measure to separate the task related components depending 
  on the model time course or spatial template. </dd></dl>
