<h4>MEX Files</h4>
<hr>


<p> <strong>Group ICA MEX binaries </strong> </p>

<p> 
We now provide C-MEX files for computing eigen values of a symmetric
matrix. The compiled MEX binaries are used only when you select
packed storage scheme for computing covariance matrix during the
second or third data reduction stage. To compile the MEX source
code, type icatb_compile_mex_files at the MATLAB command
prompt. The source code is located in icatb/icatb_mex_files/src.

<p> <strong>SPM MEX binaries</strong></p>

<p>
We use SPM volume functions to read and write image data and prefix
those files with icatb_. Since SPM5 writes analyze images
with a Nifti field in it, we use SPM2 functions to write analyze
images. If you get "Bad image handle dimensions" error while loading
the data follow any of the instructions below:

<ul>

<li> Run script icatb_copy_spm_binaries.m to copy the
appropriate SPM MEX binaries. This script will take into account the
MATLAB version and the Operating Systems like Windows and Linux 64
bit. After the copying is done, restart MATLAB.</li>

<li> Manually copy SPM MEX binaries to the appropriate SPM version
directories in GIFT. Please see below:

<ul>

<li> Copy SPM2 MEX binaries like spm_list_files.mexext, spm_sample_vol.mexext, spm_slice_vol.mexext 
to the directory icatb/icatb_spm2_files and prefix them with icatb_.</li>

<li> Copy SPM5 MEX binaries like mat2file.mexext, spm_sample_vol.mexext, spm_slice_vol.mexext 
to the directory icatb/icatb_spm5_files and prefix them with icatb_.</li>


<strong>Note:</strong> mexext is the MEX file extension on your
Operating System. Type mexext on the MATLAB command window to
get the MEX file extension on the Operating System you are working
on.

</ul>
