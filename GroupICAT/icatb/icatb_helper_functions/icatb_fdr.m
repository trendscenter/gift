% fdr() - compute false detection rate mask
%
% Usage:
%   >> [p_masked, p_fdr] = icatb_fdr( pvals, alpha);
%
% Inputs:
%   pvals - vector or array of p-values
%   alpha - threshold value (non-corrected)
%
% Outputs:
%   p_fdr    - pvalue used for threshold (based on independence
%              or positive dependence of measurements)
%   p_masked - p-value thresholded. Same size as pvals.
