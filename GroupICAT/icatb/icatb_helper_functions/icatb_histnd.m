function h = icatb_histnd(data, varargin)
%HISTND N-D histogram count
%   H = HISTND(DATA, EDGE1, EDGE2, EDGE3, ...) returns a histogram
%   matrix which is EDGE1-by-EDGE2-by-EDGE3-by-... in size, where
%   each element is the number of realizations of DATA that fall
%   within the appropriate bin in each respective EDGE vector.
%   DATA must be an M-by-N matrix, where M is the number of
%   realizations and N is the number of types of measurements,
%   whose bins are givin by each EDGE vector.  N must be equal to
%   the number of input EDGE vectors.
%
%   Like the MATALAB function HISTC, H(k1, k2, k3, ...) will count
%   the realization DATA(i, :) if:
%       EDGE1(k1) <= DATA(i, 1) < EDGE1(k1+1) AND
%       EDGE2(k2) <= DATA(i, 2) < EDGE2(k2+1) AND
%       EDGE3(k3) <= DATA(i, 3) < EDGE3(k3+1) AND ...
%   Any values outside of their respective EDGE vectors are not
%   counted.  Use -Inf and Inf to include all non-NaN values.
%
%   Example:
%       H = HISTND(RAND(1000, 1), 0:.25:1) is the same as
%       H = HISTC(RAND(1000, 1), 0:.25:1).
%
%       H = HISTND(RESHAPE(PASCAL(6), 18, 2), 0:10:30, 0:100:300)
%       returns the array [14 1 0 0;
%                          1  1 0 0;
%                          0  0 1 0;
%                          0  0 0 0]
